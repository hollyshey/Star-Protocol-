# Star Protocol

Star Protocol is a novel architecture for predictive, self-regulating systems inspired by star-shaped network dynamics. This project introduces a five-directional symbolic language, harmonic feedback mechanisms, and dynamic core clocking to model intelligent behavior without traditional mining or centralized control.

## Key Concepts
- Star-based structure with Dirac singularities
- Predictive cycles based on dynamic clock and node interactions
- Machine language with 5 signals: ↑ ↓ ← → • (silence)
- Resource-efficient alternative to blockchain consensus mechanisms

## Current Status
First experimental implementation and performance evaluation have shown promising accuracy (73%) using real blockchain data.
